<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and considers a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>The technique to be selected for IPM depends upon numerous aspects, the essential of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests cause considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If basic house health is neglected, the results of other types of pest control will be incredibly short-term as the pests will quickly be back, and in higher numbers.</p>

Nevertheless, the significant pattern has actually been towards making use of modern chemistry and molecular biology to change standard pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; however these means are still rehabs.</p>
