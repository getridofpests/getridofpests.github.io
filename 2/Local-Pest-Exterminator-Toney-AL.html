D's has been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control in addition to fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming arising from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>A particular pest can be managed by certain options, but they might not all be readily available in a specific location, for a particular crop, or within the available monetary methods. IPM includes using the best combination of cultural, biological and chemical steps for particular circumstances, including plant biotechnology as proper. This preparation includes attention to field histories to expect what the pest issues may be, selecting crop ranges which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, picking tillage systems that will reduce expected pest damage while giving the crop the greatest yield potential.</p>
<p>They believed that some qualities of areawide management are incompatible with many traditional IRM methods, but recommended that using biologically based control strategies, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, may contribute to both areawide pest management and IRM. Pesticides are chemicals developed to kill or damage pests. Corder Pest Control is a family-owned company that was founded on the fundamental principles of honesty, integrity, and effort.</p>
