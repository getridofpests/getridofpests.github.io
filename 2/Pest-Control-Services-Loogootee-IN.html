The benefit of the misting pest control approach is that it's thought about to be eco-friendly, it's odorless and doesn't leave any residues that are challenging to be cleaned up.

<p>Tighter guidelines for food safety, occupational health and safety, and the environment imply in-house pest control isn't a choice for many food organisations these days.
