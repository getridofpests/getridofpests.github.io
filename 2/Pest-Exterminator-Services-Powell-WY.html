<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dosage when other methods of pest control have failed.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries offers comprehensive information on IPM practices in broadacre cropping and in horticulture, including techniques for specific pest types and crops.</p>
<p>Consider alternative techniques (aside from pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can endure pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a structure. Recent quests for efficient, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted mostly toward development of new and better items with which to replace conventional harmful pesticides.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies much of the exact same concepts as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to minimize the requirement for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
