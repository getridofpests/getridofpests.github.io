<p>Whether you have rodents or routine pests like ants, spiders, or roaches, we will recognize the source of the issue. The objective is to offer a general understanding of the concepts of IPM, together with the principles for implementation in all crops. When a crop is under stress it can be less efficient in dealing with the tension brought on by insects that draw out plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this stress may slightly reduce the economic threshold.</p>
