To control particular pests, several applications of natural pesticides may be required with associated threats and costs, while similar pest populations could be controlled by fewer chemical pesticide applications.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, papers, books, and even documents kept in lockers and safes, thus triggering enormous damage within simply a few months.
