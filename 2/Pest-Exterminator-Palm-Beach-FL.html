<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is normally used where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been efficiently used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is caused thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a rich community likely will have a lot of large, expensive homes, so pest control costs might be higher there due to the fact that there's more area for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses.</p>
