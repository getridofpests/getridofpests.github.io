Do not base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest. Pests assault plants from everywhere: rodents and nematode spoil roots in the earth, snails, and larvae destroy leaves and berries originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds assaulting from the air.</p>

The healing method of eliminating pest organisms with hazardous chemicals has actually been the prevailing pest control technique for over 50 years.
