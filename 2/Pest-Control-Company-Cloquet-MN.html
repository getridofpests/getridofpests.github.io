<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) secures environment through elimination of unnecessary pesticide applications. These professionals understand the result of pesticides and ensure they use the right ones (in the correct amount) and use it in such a method that you and your household are exposed to little or no risk after the application. Since 2003, most of new pesticide registrations have fulfilled requirements set by EPA for reduced danger" consisting of lower threats to human health and non-target organisms, and minimize prospective for contamination of groundwater, surface area water, and other ecological resources.</p>
<p>In addition to establishing clear indications that a pest control program is certainly an IPM system, it is also required to provide requirements to measure performance of the system. Usually in between 30 minutes to 2 hours is needed to perform the general pest control treatment. Public demand is influenced by retail marketing techniques, issues for food security based on pesticide guidelines in their region, and an absence of understanding on food production to name a few factors.</p>
<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your house unattractive to them. But family pests can also be a danger to your family. When searching for a place to infest, pests choose to hide in a location that supplies food and a safe breeding place. Biological control is a lot easier to carry out in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (multiple crops).</p>
<p>Typically, the main goal of IPM programs is on farming insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, originally established for farming pest management, IPM programs are now developed to incorporate diseases, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management objectives of websites such as residential and commercial structures, yard and grass areas, and house and community gardens.</p>
