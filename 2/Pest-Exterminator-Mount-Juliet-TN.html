<p>At the same time, it is likewise based upon semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are repelled or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ).
