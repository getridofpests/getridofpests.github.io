<p>Numerous newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally occurring substances (e.g.-- insect, pyrethrum and nicotine juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active part may be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. If we cultivate crops according to the principle of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), a lot of researchers agree that this will be possible only.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is likewise based upon semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are repelled or deterred far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are concurrently attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ).
