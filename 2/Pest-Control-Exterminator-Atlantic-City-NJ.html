<p>Our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique is based upon our four principles that together we call ERDM. We understand that discovering pests in your home or business is traumatic. Versatility and Time- The process of pest control takes time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, germs or other organisms that hinder human activity.</p>
<p>Go with the least hazardous (or lowest schedule) family pesticide available. Most people generally think of pest control during the warmer months, when swarms of insects attempt to attack their houses and lawns, however, pests know no season. A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides originated from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally happening products.</p>
<p>Ecologically safe: Many biological control representatives are environmental experts. Standards and legislation concerning the use, allowed approaches of application and the storage conditions of pesticides and chemicals differ from country to nation, often being enacted laws by each state of area. Research study and outreach are an important part of the IPM model to anticipate and recognize pest problems, establish alleviative and preventive strategies, and effectively distribute the details through conventional and modern communication tools and techniques.</p>
