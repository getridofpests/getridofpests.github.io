Predators kill their victim that damages crops, for instance, ladybugs decrease aphid numbers. Sometimes release of natural enemies even before the pest exists is possible, or needed for ideal effectiveness. The preliminary treatment consists of inspections, extermination of existing pests and perimeter outdoor treatments.</p>
<p>The success of control tactics need to be determined using signs based on monitoring of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and impact on the environment. These include the revival of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and negative effect on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
