Due to any number of reasons, including those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural opponents often enables potential pest organisms to experience virtually uncontrolled population development and enables them to reach pest status.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to manage specific plant illness and arthropod pests through nonchemical methods in some crops (Flinckh et al. 2006 ).
