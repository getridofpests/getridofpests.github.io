<p>This physical control puts an instant end to pests' plant-damaging days. Pesticides not contained in traps or baits must usually only be used to targeted places, not sprayed over the whole room. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach that includes the management of a pest rather of removing a pest or controlling. TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl areas, and specially engineered weather stripping for garage and entry doors not just deter rodents and other devastating pests from living and entering in your house, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
