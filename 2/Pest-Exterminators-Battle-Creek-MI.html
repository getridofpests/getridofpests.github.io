<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>If left untreated, rodents can cause disastrous damage to your home and your family's health. The complete expression "Integrated Pest Management" (IPM) appeared in press, for the very first time, 28 years back (Kogan 1998).
