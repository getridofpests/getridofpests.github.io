Besides regular external spraying, whenever there was believed to be a danger of a pest issue establishing, there was no recorded or regular pest control program at MTSL at the time of the initial audit.</p>
<p>Current research studies document the need for continued decreases in hazardous pesticide usage and practices.

When searching for a place to infest, pests choose to conceal in a location that provides food and a safe breeding place.
