<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical ways to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dose when other approaches of pest control have failed.

<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are tremendous straight to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control involves using living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides. There are four major elements in the new IPM design that address different pest management choices, the knowledge, and resources the grower has to resolve the pest issue, preparation and organization of info to take suitable management actions, and keeping excellent communication to share and get knowledge about pests and their management.</p>
<p>Throughout numerous outreach conferences and field tours organized specifically for the general public in Southern California during the previous few years, it appeared that a majority was not familiar with farming systems, had misconstruing about sustainable agriculture, and thought that organic food is pesticide-free (Dara individual observations and unpublished study data).</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies a lot of the same ideas as IPM but restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
