For that reason, a simple switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural opponents, although useful in lowering ecological contamination and security problems, still does not really attend to the ecologically based weak point of the standard pest control approach.</p>
<p>Constant monitoring and tracking of insect pests population is important for assessment of damage and for figuring out the requirements for actions to be taken. Chemical pest control is using pesticides to destroy hazardous insects ororganisms. Current concern for pollinator health has actually also led to limitations on the use of specific pesticides. To prevent plant damage, don't spray any plants suffering from moisture stress.</p>
