<p>Constant monitoring and tracking of insect pests population is important for assessment of damage and for figuring out the requirements for actions to be taken. Chemical pest control is using pesticides to destroy hazardous insects ororganisms. Current concern for pollinator health has actually also led to limitations on the use of specific pesticides. To prevent plant damage, don't spray any plants suffering from moisture stress.</p>
