<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a cost-effective and environmentally benign pest control technique ideally fit for both small and large farmers around the globe. Once termites have actually gone into a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making process in which observations (from inspection and tracking) are utilized to make pest control decisions based on pre-determined management objectives.</p>
<p>Throughout numerous outreach meetings and field trips arranged specifically for the public in Southern California throughout the past few years, it appeared that a majority was not aware of farming systems, had misconstruing about sustainable agriculture, and thought that natural food is pesticide-free (Dara personal observations and unpublished survey information).</p>

<p>Pest management needs a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used just after routine monitoring shows that a pest population had reached a financial limit level. Lots of individual commodity growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM means for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted locations.</p>
<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest efficient dose when other approaches of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-lasting prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>The many varying hazards from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage companies to establish an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their buildings and collections. In these countries, regular use of pesticides is restricted to high value (money) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, rice, sugarcane, and soybean.</p>
