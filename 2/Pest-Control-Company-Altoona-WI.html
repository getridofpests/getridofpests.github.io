<p>In reference to the principle of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to accept collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

<p>Termites consume furnishings, documents, books, and even documents kept in safes and lockers, therefore causing enormous damage within just a couple of months. This stops the pest acquiring resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to client homes and businesses to check for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes presenting natural opponents from a pest's native range into a new location where native natural enemies do not supply control.</p>
