<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and takes into account a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>We traditionally have actually sold nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the effectiveness of environmentally unsound techniques in addition to its range of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and types of parasitoids have actually been picked for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
