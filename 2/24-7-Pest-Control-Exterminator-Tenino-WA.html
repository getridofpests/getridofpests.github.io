The brand-new ribonucleic acid disturbance (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is used to silence specific genes in the target bug is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Specific biostimulants based upon minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stress factors, however are used as amendments without any claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These new products or technologies can fall under several abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
