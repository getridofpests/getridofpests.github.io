<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control method is typically used where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been effectively used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>A pest can be a plant (weed), vertebrate (bird, rodent, or other mammal), invertebrate (insect, tick, mite, or snail), nematode, pathogen (bacteria, infection, or fungi) that causes disease, or other unwanted organism that might harm water quality, animal life, or other parts of the environment.
