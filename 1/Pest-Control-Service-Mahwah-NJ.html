<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its ability to reduce the effects of the efficiency of ecologically unsound techniques along with its selection of intrinsic strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the possibility that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>Many more recent pesticides are stemmed from plants or naturally occurring compounds (e.g.-- bug, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormonal agent analogues), however the toxophore or active component might be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. Most researchers agree that this will be possible just if we cultivate crops according to the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
