<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for soil, water, and air quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds instead of an entire location. Due to any number of factors, including those mentioned in the Chemical and Cultural areas, compromising the effectiveness of natural opponents often enables prospective pest organisms to experience essentially unregulated population development and enables them to reach pest status.</p>
