Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
