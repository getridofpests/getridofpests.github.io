<p>For example, diesel-powered tractors are run for vacuuming western stained bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more every week while a pesticide application normally needs using tractor as soon as every 7-14 d. To control particular pests, multiple applications of organic pesticides might be needed with associated threats and costs, while similar pest populations could be controlled by less chemical pesticide applications.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest issues, classical biological control technique is normally utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been efficiently used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
