<p>Also, consider how the variety of plants to be grown in the exact same location might affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness. Pest control involves non-lethal approaches too, such as keeping the location clean and free of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the space between the bottom of a door and the flooring.</p>
<p>This information, in mix with available pest control techniques, is used to handle pest damage by the most economical means, and with the minimal danger to people, property, and the environment.

<p>Kaolin particle films used in natural farming may control some pests, but can adversely impact natural opponents and trigger other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may motivate natural enemy populations, but a greater number of natural opponents does not constantly lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative impact on the environment.</p>
