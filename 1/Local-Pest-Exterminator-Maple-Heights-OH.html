<p>In referral to the concept of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to accept coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

The idea of IPM is to keep an eye on and control pests only when they start appearing and getting rid of the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM strategies, Scope of works, application techniques and market specific record keeping procedures.</p>

<p>Community IPM practitioners work to identify and fix pest-friendly conditions, eliminating access to food, water and harborage by improving sanitation, maintenance, exclusion and landscape management practices.
