<p>Knowledgeable field teams will be able to keep track of and recognize pest issues and effectively execute the management strategies. The idea of integrated pest management (IPM) stemmed almost 60 years back in action to these negative effects of pesticides. Several of the resources listed at the end of this leaflet can be used for identification of insect pests affecting collections.</p>
