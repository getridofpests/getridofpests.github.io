When a crop is under tension it can be less capable of handling the tension caused by insects that draw out plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this stress might slightly reduce the financial limit.</p>
<p>Numerous newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally happening substances (e.g.-- bug, pyrethrum and nicotine juvenile hormone analogues), however the toxophore or active part might be altered to offer increased biological activity or stability. If we cultivate crops according to the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), most researchers concur that this will be possible only.</p>
