<p>Socio-psychological elements including rational and moral considerations were found to the drivers in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or disease occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
