<p>Some of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, efficient versus drawing pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, effective against red cotton bug, cutworms, insects; botanical mixes, combinations of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, etc</p>
<p>This method of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in recent years because fire eliminates beneficial insects along with the pests and can have a negative influence on the soil. To minimize possible damage to useful insects, restrict your spraying to little locations where you can see pests hiding, and leave a number of unsprayed "havens" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
