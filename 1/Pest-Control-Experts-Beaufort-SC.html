<p>You are safe, sure and safe and secure with HICARE's termite pest control services. Vermins are infamously challenging to control. Pests look for locations with an abundant food source, in addition to a safe environment in which they can reproduce. Other reasonably low-risk pesticides are readily available for some pests. Inoculative biological control means launching natural enemies periodically or seasonally to restore a balance that has not been maintained naturally or has actually been disrupted by other control methods.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest determination consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
