<p>You are safe, sure and safe and secure with HICARE's termite pest control services. Insects are notoriously hard to control. Pests seek out locations with a plentiful food source, as well as a safe environment in which they can reproduce. Other relatively low-risk pesticides are available for some pests. Inoculative biological control suggests releasing natural opponents periodically or seasonally to reestablish a balance that has actually not been kept naturally or has actually been interrupted by other control techniques.</p>
<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of ecologically unsound approaches in addition to its selection of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, stress of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the likelihood that some will survive insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>

Techniques used in Integrated Pest Management programs range from preventative and cultural measures to using biological, physical, behavioral and chemical controls.
