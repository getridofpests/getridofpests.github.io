<p>Part of this success came from field schools which enabled local farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and usage of pest control actions that will guarantee beneficial economic condition, social and eco-friendly repercussions 13 and is applicable to many agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations.</p>
<p>Some also recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM could occur, even annual management of a constant pest could be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We recruit exterminators who specialize in commercial or industrial pest control. Continuous training and education of farmers represent the foundation for facility of strong and reliable IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
<p>Using natural enemies as a curative control is less effective compared to applying them preventively. Employ proper hunting strategies and treatment choices to preserve the useful insects that can offer additional insect pest control. Thoroughly monitor fields for all pests to determine the requirement for remedial insecticide treatments. Now long term reliable pest control is offered on your fingertips.</p>
<p>A redirection of pest management is required to integrate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and community levels and to think about the results of these practices on the general fauna, nutritional state, and balance of local ecosystems (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to explain an organized approach of managing pests using non-chemical pest management techniques and the cautious use of pesticides when pest populations exceed acceptable levels.</p>
