IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat control, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>Before signing an agreement for pest control, you must be clear about the cost being paid, the services being covered and the existence of cancellation charges, Anti-Pesto says. You can use traps to capture particular pests, and barriers to safeguard plants from insect attack or illness infection.
