<h3>Pest And Pest Control Fort Oglethorpe Georgia</h2>
<p>Pests can end up being a costly problem for your business if left to their own gadgets. If more monitoring, recognitions and action limits indicate that less dangerous controls are not working, then additional pest control techniques would be used, such as targeted spraying of pesticides.

<p>Some of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, effective against sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, efficient against red cotton bug, cutworms, insects; botanical mixes, combinations of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, cold, gliricidia, marigold, and so on</p>

Chemical controls were to be used only after regular monitoring showed that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic threshold) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the cost of the control steps.</p>
