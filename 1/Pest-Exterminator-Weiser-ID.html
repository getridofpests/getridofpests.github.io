The following example describes the six elements of an Integrated Pest Management program used to handle carpenter ants. Focusing primarily on long-lasting pest prevention, an effective IPM program uses a mix of control approaches including biological control, habitat manipulation, modifications to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>When pest problems are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulas or its cry toxins in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>

When it is really needed, spec of plagued areas and differentiated application of plant protection products reduce the damage for human beings and nature as chemicals are used only.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the term IPM has been coopted by the chemical industry to imply essentially anything a practitioner desires it to imply, Beyond Pesticides has actually welcomed the phrase Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus practitioners need to have -emphasizing the broader ecology of pest management and preventing harmful chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
