<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the environment as an entire and takes into account a well balanced mix of the previously mentioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least harmful strategy.</p>
<p>The method to be chosen for IPM depends on lots of factors, the essential of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic aspect of the management. Insect pests cause considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If basic home hygiene is ignored, the effects of other kinds of pest control will be incredibly short-lived as the pests will quickly be back, and in higher numbers.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest issues, classical biological control method is usually utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively utilized versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
