<p>Natural opponents such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very reliable in causing considerable reductions in pest populations in certain scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

<p>A redirection of pest management is required to incorporate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and neighborhood levels and to consider the impacts of these practices on the general fauna, nutritional state, and balance of regional ecosystems (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to explain a systematic approach of managing pests utilizing non-chemical pest management approaches and the sensible use of pesticides when pest populations go beyond appropriate levels.</p>
