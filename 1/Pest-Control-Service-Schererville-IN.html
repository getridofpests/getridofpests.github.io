<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest determination include intercropping (numerous crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>

Classical biological control includes introducing natural enemies from a pest's native range into a brand-new area where native natural enemies do not provide control.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have actually been routinely using a lot of these IPM strategies for decades or perhaps generations - methods such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations vulnerable to pests, or using tolerant or resistant varieties. Sovereign Pest Control and its affiliated companies offer quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 property owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee.</p>
