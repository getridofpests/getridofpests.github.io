<p>Socio-psychological factors including reasonable and ethical factors to consider were discovered to the chauffeurs in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al.

<p>We historically have actually sold nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the efficiency of environmentally unsound techniques as well as its array of fundamental strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous termites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, consequently increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
