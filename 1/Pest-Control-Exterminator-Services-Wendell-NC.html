With IPM, you act to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Current quests for effective, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted mostly toward advancement of brand-new and better items with which to replace conventional harmful pesticides.</p>
