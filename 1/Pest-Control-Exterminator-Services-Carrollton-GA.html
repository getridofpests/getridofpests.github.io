<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as an entire and takes into account a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least destructive strategy.</p>

Although the basic elements of IPM are constantly the exact same, the particular elements of an IPM program differ from one environment or circumstance to another. Application of predatory mites against thrips in potted plants is more reliable when done before spacing the plants.</p>
