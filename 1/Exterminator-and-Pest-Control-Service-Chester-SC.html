<p>WebMD veterinary professionals answer commonly asked concerns about fleas and ticks on your pet. Socio-psychological aspects consisting of reasonable and ethical factors to consider were found to the motorists in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of certified IPM professionals and extension educators was an impediment for IPM implementation in industrialized countries.</p>
