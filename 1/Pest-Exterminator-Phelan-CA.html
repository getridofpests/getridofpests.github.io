<p>In recommendation to the principle of incorporating using other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on widened to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).

<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly attain levels at which damage is triggered therefore ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare).
