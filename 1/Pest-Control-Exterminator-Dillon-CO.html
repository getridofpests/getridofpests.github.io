<p>The behavior of the pest can be made use of for its monitoring and control through baits, traps, and breeding disturbance techniques (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). Baits consisting of dangerous product will attract and kill the pests when distributed in the field or placed in traps.</p>
<p>We traditionally have actually offered nature short, both in its ability to neutralize the effectiveness of ecologically unsound approaches along with its variety of inherent strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been chosen for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, therefore increasing the possibility that some will make it through insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
<p>We're applying our proficiency to establish more reliable and sustainable pest control techniques.
