<p>Socio-psychological elements including rational and ethical considerations were found to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness incident and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
