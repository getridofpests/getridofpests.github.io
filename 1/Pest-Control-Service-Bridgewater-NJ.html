<p>We act legally and in accordance with Pest control regulations effective in USA. For the previous few years, pest management specialists have been utilizing contraception for pest birds such as pigeons as a method of managing populations. IPM intends to keep making use of pesticides and other types of intervention just to levels that are financially and ecologically justified and which lower or reduce risk to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>A redirection of pest management is needed to integrate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and community levels and to think about the impacts of these practices on the overall fauna, nutritional state, and balance of local communities (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to explain a systematic technique of managing pests utilizing non-chemical pest management methods and the judicious usage of pesticides when pest populations surpass acceptable levels.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was hence synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine tracking indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the expense of the control steps.</p>
